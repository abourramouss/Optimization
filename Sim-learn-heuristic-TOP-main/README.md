# Sim-learn-heuristic-TOP

This repository serves as a template for implementing new Sim-learn heuristics. Sim-Learn heuristics are algorithms that leverage simulation techniques to solve optimization problems that introduce stochastic and dynamic inputs.

## About
The code in this repository implements a Sim-learn-heuristic for the Team Orienteering Problem with random travel times., which has been reviewed by Angel A. Juan in June 2023. The purpose of this template is to provide a starting point for researchers and practitioners interested in developing their own sim-learn heuristics.

## Directory Structure

The repository follows a standard directory structure commonly used for organizing code projects. Here is an overview of the main directories and their purpose:

- `data/`: Reserved for storing any inputs files required for running the algorithm or evaluating its performance.
- `tests/`: Intended for storing the test files required for running the algorithm or evaluating its performance.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged. If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvement, or want to extend the functionality of the template, please submit a pull request. Be sure to follow the existing code style and include appropriate tests and documentation for any changes.

## Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this repository, please feel free to contact Angel A. Juan, Javier Panadero or Xabier A. Martin.
